Requirements
- macOS with Xcode installed
- Xcode 12+ recommended
- iOS 13.0+ (update to match the project's deployment target)

Getting started
1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/SohamB4746Y/Calculator_Ios.git
2. Open the project in Xcode
   - Open Calculator_Ios.xcodeproj or Calculator_Ios.xcworkspace (if present)
3. Select a target device or simulator and press Run (⌘R)

Usage
- Tap numeric buttons to enter numbers.
- Use arithmetic buttons (+, −, ×, ÷) to build expressions.
- Tap = to compute the result.
- Tap AC to clear the current entry.
- Tap ± to toggle sign.
- Tap % to convert the current entry to a percentage.

Project structure
- All source files are written in Swift.
- Update this section to describe the UI framework used (UIKit with Storyboards/XIBs or SwiftUI) and the high-level architecture (MVC, MVVM, etc.).

Testing
- Manual testing on device or simulator.
- Consider adding unit tests for the calculation logic in the future.
